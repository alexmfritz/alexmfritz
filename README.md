# Welcome! 

My name is Alex Fritz and I am a Front-End Software Developer student at [Turing](https://turing.edu/), based out of the Seattle metro. Prior to Turing, I was an athlete in the outdoor industry and I had some incredible opportunities to travel and meet some awesome people. Through that time, I discovered a passion for teaching and sharing my positive experiences with others. I'm excited to leave Turing with an incredible set of skills so I can take that passion for teaching and give back to the next generation of programmers.
